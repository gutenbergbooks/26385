<p>SCENE&mdash;<i>The Elysian Fields, a flower-gemmed bank, by a flowing stream,
beneath the sylvan shade of unfading foliage.</i><br />
Mr. <span class="sc">Punch</span>&mdash;<i>who is free
of all places, from Fleet Street to Parnassus&mdash;discovered, in Arcadian
attire, attempting "numerous verse" on a subject of National
importance&mdash;to wit, the approaching Royal Marriage.</i></p>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Mr. Punch.</i> Propt on this "bank of amaranth and moly,"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Beneath the shade of boughs <i>un</i>melancholy,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">I meditate on &AElig;stas and on Hymen!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Pheugh! <i>What</i> a Summer! Torrid drought doth try men,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And fields and farms; yet when our Royal <span class="sc">May</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Weds&mdash;in July&mdash;'tis fit that Phoebus stay</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">His fiery car to welcome her! By Jove,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">That sounds Spenserian! Illustrious Love</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Epithalamion demands, and lo!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">We've no official Laureate, to let flow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">With Tennysonian dignity and sweetness,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Courtly congratulation. <span class="sc">Dryden</span>'s neatness,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Even the gush of <span class="sc">Nahum Tate</span> or <span class="sc">Pye</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Are not available, so <span class="sc">Punch</span> must try</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">His unofficial pen. My tablets, <span class="sc">Toby</span>!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">This heat's enough to give you hydrophoby!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Talk about Dog-days! Is that nectar iced?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Then just one gulp! It beats the highest priced</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And creamiest champagne. Now, silence, Dog,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And let me give my lagging Muse a jog!</span><br /><br />

<div class="direction">[<i>Writes, with one eye on the portraits of the</i> Duke of <span class="sc">York</span> <i>and</i>

<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Humph! I do hope the happy Royal Pair</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">(Whose counterfeit presentments front me there,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Inspiring, in young manhood and frank beauty)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Will think their Laureate hath fulfilled his duty,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">His labour of most loyal love, discreetly.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Compliments delicate, piled not sickly-sweetly,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Like washy <span class="sc">Warton</span>'s, nor so loud thrasonical&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Like Glorious <span class="sc">John</span>'s&mdash;that they sound half ironical!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">'Tis hard indeed for loyal love to hit</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">The medium just 'twixt sentiment and wit&mdash;&mdash;</span><br /><br />

<p><span class="sc">"Bang went Sax-pence!"</span>&mdash;<i>&Agrave; propos</i> of the New Coinage, the <i>Pall Mall

of the half-crown has been prepared by Mr. <span class="sc">Brock</span>." <span class="sc">Brock</span> is a name
hitherto associated in the popular mind with fireworks; and if the work
be entrusted to this cunning artificer, he will make the New Coinage go
off splendidly. He has, we believe, already submitted illuminated

with <i>A White Lie</i>. This is the truth. Free admissions will not be heard
of, except when they give <i>A Scrap of Paper</i>. They are also going to
produce a new play entitled, <i>Prince Karatoff</i>. The plot, to judge by
the name, will be of interest to Vegetarians, as it is whispered that
the hero, <i>Prince Karatoff</i>, falls in love with <i>Princess Turnipon</i>.</p>

werry ancient Deputty said, as he was a helping him to his jugged air,
he had werry little dowt but that County Counsellors was acshally a
going in for erbollishing the hold Copperashun altogether! if they can
git the Goverment to be fools enuff for to promise to 'elp 'em. And
then, from what he heard from others, they are a going to rob the nobel
and Charytable Liwery Companys of all the money as they spends so nobly;
and then, not contented with that, they are a going for to ask Parlyment
to give them the command of all the sixteen thowsand Policemen as there
is in the hole of London; and then, not content with that, they are a
going for to erbolish all the eight Water Companys, and manage it all
theirselves; and then, not content with that, they are a going to take
all the Meet Markets, and the Fish Markets, includin Ancient
Billingsgate, and the Fruit and Wegeral Markets; and then, just to fill
up sum of their lezzur time, they are a going to erbolish the Thames
Conserwaters, and manage the River theirselves; and then, as they think
as them little trifles ain't quite enuff for 'em, they are a going to
arsk to be aloud to take charge of all the Docks and Wharfs on the
River! And then, as they will naterally want plenty of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> emusement after
their ard work, they arsks to be aloud to take over the control of All
the London Theaters!</p>

<p>I had a chat the other day with one of the <span class="sc">Lord Mare</span>'s Footmen, as I
allers likes to go to the werry hiest orthorities, and he finished by
saying, most emfatically,&mdash;"Mr. <span class="sc">Robert</span>, I arsks you this simple

grand old Citty in the bootiful condishun as it allus is, and to keep us
all in the helthy condishun as we allus is, and with the remarkabel fine
happytites as we allus has, its size being ony one square mile, and our
number ony about fifty thowsand sleepers, and about ten times as many,
as cums ewery day to hearn their living, how is it possibel for a much
smaller number of Gents, with werry littel hexperiens, to do the same
with a plaice about a hunderd and twenty times as big, and with about
five millions of peepel in it? And you may trust what I says, for I had
it from our Chapling."</p>

<p>"Why," I says, boldly, "I says at once as I don't beleeve as it's
posserbel for 'em to do a quorter of it."</p>

<p>"Rite you are, Mr. <span class="sc">Robert</span>!" says he. And so we parted.</p>

<h2>AT ANCIENT DRURY.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 30%;">
<a href="images/illus-004a.png">
<img src="images/illus-004a.png" width="100%" alt="actor and  actress" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="sc">Druriolanus Magnificus</span> has given us something gorgeous this year in "The
Hall of a Million Mirrors," the tenth Scene of his Pantomime entitled
<i>Little Bo-Peep, Little Red Riding Hood, and Hop o' My Thumb</i>, who are
three very small people,&mdash;"small by degrees and beautifully less"&mdash;to
make so big a Show. In the Hall of Mirrors appear all the well-known
representatives of ancient Nursery Rhymes, and all the heroes and
heroines of the universally familiar Fairy Stories. Down the Palace
stairs they come, group after group, until the Stage, even of Old Drury,
can hold no more, and there is scarcely room for them all to move, much
less to indulge in any "kicking up ahind and afore," as was the wont of
the Ancient <span class="sc">Joseph</span>, whose fame is hymned in Nigger Minstrelsy. A most
brilliant scene, never to be forgotten!&mdash;that is, until next Pantomime
Season, when Sir <span class="sc">Druriolanus</span> will, in all probability, show us something
equally magnificent, and as perfect in design and colour.</p>

<p>There is such a galaxy of talent, specially of Music-hall talent, with
the two <span class="sc">Maries</span>, <span class="sc">Loftus</span> and <span class="sc">Lloyd</span>, the <span class="sc">Campbell</span> of that ilk, comical <span class="sc">Dan
Leno</span> (who looks so comically Thin O), and the amusing Brothers
<span class="sc">Griffiths</span>, but without the donkey, and with no quadruped to equal him,
though they do make beasts of themselves by appearing as wolves, who
will not be kept from the door of <i>Granny Green</i>, Mr. <span class="sc">John D'Auban</span>,
utterly unrecognisable. Besides these is a Variety Show of other Stars,
including ever-graceful <span class="sc">Emma D'Auban</span>, and Miss <span class="sc">Mabel Love</span>, of the
"skirts-so movement," both rightly reckoned in the programme as among
"the Immortals." Only one fault can be found with the Pantomime, and
that is, that there are too many brilliant Stars in it. They can't all
of them, each and severally, get an opportunity of showing how he or she
can shine in his or her own particular bright way; and so it happens
that the earliest scenes, which are less crowded, are the best for fun,
though in the latter, and specially in the one just preceding the
transformation, there is some capital comic business, and "<span class="sc">Little Tich</span>"
is at his best in his burlesque of the Skirt Dance. We wonder that this
clever diminutive person has never appeared as "<i>the</i> Claimant <i>par
excellence</i>." But perhaps his name is not "<span class="sc">Tich</span>" at all, and so, on his
first appearance on the world's stage, he was not a "<i>Tich-born</i>."</p>

<p>The <i>Extravaganza</i> portion of the Pantomime&mdash;formerly styled the
"Opening"&mdash;gave us great pleasure, and the two "Comic Scenes"&mdash;(what are
all the preceding ones? Are <span class="sc">Campbell</span>, <span class="sc">Leno</span>, <span class="sc">Williams</span>, and "<span class="sc">Little Tich</span>,"
all tragedians?)&mdash;gave us Great <span class="sc">Payne</span>&mdash;yclept <span class="sc">Harry Payne</span>, the good old
Conservative "<span class="sc">Joey</span>."</p>

<p>If the possibilities, "<i>per variation et mutation</i>" of gorgeous modern
Pantomime, are exhausted&mdash;"which," as <span class="sc">Euclid</span> observes, "is
impossible"&mdash;except we may "add a rider" (as the Clown in the Circle
might observe) that Pantomime is, in itself, a <i>reductio ad
absurdum</i>&mdash;then, perchance, Sir <span class="sc">Druriolanus Magnificus</span> may give us next
Christmas a Shorter Opening, say ten Scenes, to be followed by six
Harlequinade Scenes, treating, by way of "Review," all the leading
topics of Ninety-Three. <i>Nous verrons</i>&mdash;at least, such is our hope. And
so a Prosperous New Year to Sir <span class="sc">Druriolanus</span>, and all his works.</p>

<h2>NOVEL, BUT NOT NEW.</h2>

<center><span class="sc">Scene I.</span>&mdash;<i>Publisher's Sanctum.</i> Amateur Author <i>discovered in</i>
<i>consultation with</i> Enterprising Publisher.</center><br />

<p><i>Enterprising Publisher.</i> Yes, my dear Sir, I think, if you pay all the
expenses, we can see our way to giving <i>An Oppressed Ophelia</i> a chance.</p>

<p><i>Amateur Author.</i> You would not take a small risk?</p>

<p><i>Ent. Publisher.</i> Why no, my dear Sir. I do not see how <i>An Oppressed
Ophelia</i> can be made a safe investment without your entire assistance.
Possibly we may treat about your next novel, which I understand you to
say is called <i>An English Hamlet</i>, on other terms. In the meanwhile, let
us hope that <i>An Oppressed Ophelia</i> will be successful.</p>

<div class="direction">[<i>Exeunt</i> Author <i>and</i> Publisher <i>severally.</i></div><br />

<p><i>Author (gloomily).</i> And so you say that <i>An Oppressed Ophelia</i> is a
dead failure?</p>

<p><i>Publisher (more cheerfully).</i> Yes, my dear Sir, but do not be
distressed. Thanks to my foresight, and your acquiescence in a
business-like arrangement, my firm has lost nothing by the transaction.</p>

<p><i>Author (dryly).</i> That I can readily understand! Well, I suppose you
have plenty of copies you can give back to me?</p>

<p><i>Publisher.</i> Well, scarcely. You see the Londoners did not take up your
book very warmly; but we have made an arrangement to dispose of the rest
of the issue in the country at a considerable reduction.</p>

<p><i>Author.</i> And <i>An English Hamlet</i>?</p>

<p><i>Publisher.</i> We shall be glad to produce on the same terms!</p>

You seem to be out of everything!</p>

<p><i>Librarian.</i> Oh, yes, we have, Sir. Here, for instance, is one of this

<p><i>Author (pleased).</i> Oh, you have got that, have you?</p>

<p><i>Librarian.</i> Got it! Why, the whole place is full of them! To tell you
the truth, Sir, it came down by mistake. We ordered books by <span class="sc">Black,
Meredith, Stevenson</span>, and the rest of them, and they sent us back, by
accident, I suppose, a dozen copies of <i>An Oppressed Ophelia</i>. If you
would like it, Sir, I will look you out a copy with some of the leaves

<p>If my memory serves me faithfully, the above heading is a quotation from
the first verse of "<i>The British Grenadiers</i>," and is peculiarly
applicable just now to the Lessee of the St. James's Theatre, Mr. <span class="sc">George
Alexander</span>, who has got a decided success in the original Comedy, written
by Mr. <span class="sc">R. C. Carton</span>, entitled <i>Liberty Hall</i>, an excellent and a
catching name, that perhaps might have been better bestowed on a larger
picture. To play with "reserved force" until the passionate moment
arrives, is all that Mr. <span class="sc">Alexander</span> has to do; but this he does
admirably, never under-acting, never over-acting, always as natural as a
quiet gentleman, of a peculiarly romantic turn of mind, yet with a keen
but chastened appreciation of a practical joke, kept all to himself for
five months, should be.</p>

<p>Had he been compelled by circumstances to sustain the <i>alias</i>, and to continue playing the part of a <i>Burchell</i> in
<span class="sc">Goldsmith</span>'s <i>Vicar of Wakefield</i> for one month longer, could he have
done it? However, as the piece has "caught on," it may be that Mr.
<span class="sc">Alexander</span> will have to play the part of <i>Mr. Burchell alias Owen</i> for
even longer than half a year; and, as he selected the piece, and as he
plays this part excellently, it is mainly Owin' to <span class="sc">Alexander</span> that the
piece is payin.' Mr. <span class="sc">Ben Webster</span> is good as the somewhat
gentlemanly-caddish mixture called <i>The Hon. Gould Harringay</i>. Mr.
<span class="sc">Nutcombe Gould</span>, as a Family Solicitor, deeply interests everybody in the
First Act; "and then," like <i>Macbeth's</i> "poor player,"&mdash;which Mr. N. G.
isn't, far from it,&mdash;"is heard no more." Perhaps, during the Pantomime
season, he might re-appear at the finish with a slight addition to his
head-gear, as intimated in this little sketch of him, when he could
observe confidentially to the audience, "Here we are again!" But this is
only a hint, to the practical use of which, Mr. <span class="sc">Gould</span>, by the kind
permission of Mr. <span class="sc">Alexander</span>, is heartily welcome.</p>

<p>Capital is Miss <span class="sc">Fanny Coleman</span> as the housekeeper and maid-of-all-work;
and, in the small part of <i>Todman's</i> shop-boy, Master <span class="sc">Richard Saker</span>
shows that, as <i>Mr. Wardle</i> said of <i>Mr. Tupman</i>, when he brought down
the birds with his eyes shut, he is "an older hand at this than we
thought for." If he works at his profession, he will show himself "a
wise-<span class="sc">Saker</span>." Mr. <span class="sc">Holles</span> and Miss <span class="sc">Ailsa Craig</span>, in two very small but
strongly-marked character-parts, add to the general efficiency of an
exceptionally complete cast. Miss <span class="sc">Maude Millett</span> makes the indiscreet
<i>Amy Chilworth</i> a very sweet person, but it is Miss <span class="sc">Marion Terry</span> who has
in her hands the one strong dramatic situation at the end of the Third
Act. It is a situation which, no matter what might have been the
author's conception of it, depends for its effect solely and only on the
actress; and Miss <span class="sc">Marion Terry</span>, as she sits, rises to the occasion. It
is long since Mr. <span class="sc">Righton</span> has had such a part as that of <i>Todman</i>, the
quaint little old-fashioned bookshop-keeper, and to this quite
Dickensian character, the actor does thorough justice; as also does Mr.
<span class="sc">H. Vincent</span> to the somewhat highly coloured blusterous part of
<i>Briginshaw</i>. Mr. <span class="sc">Alexander</span> commences the new year well.</p>

<p class="i0">a chuckle for your ordinary sigh,</p>

<p class="i0">When they give you Christmas pudding, and consider it a treat,</p>
<p class="i0">Though they know that you are feeling far too bilious to eat&mdash;</p>

<p class="i0">Where I never hear of <span class="sc">Harris</span>, and his splendid Pantomimes.</p>
<p class="i0">Where the turkey and the goose would feel distinctly out of place,</p>
<p class="i0">Where no pallid pie of mincemeat, dares to look me in the face;</p>

<h2>MIXED NOTIONS.</h2>

<h4>No. III.&mdash;PANAMA.</h4>

<div class="direction"><span class="sc">Scene</span>, <i>and persons as before&mdash;namely, two</i> Well-informed Men, <i>an</i>
Inquirer, <i>and an</i> Average Man, <i>travelling up together in a
suburban morning-train to London.</i></div>

<p><i>First Well-informed Man.</i> Jolly old mess they seem to have got into in
Paris over this Panama business. I see they arrested half-a-dozen more
of them yesterday.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Yes&mdash;and they haven't done yet. I knew, months and
months ago, the crash must come. That French chap, <span class="sc">Lampion</span> told me all
about it. He says it'll bust up the Republic before they've done with
it.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> And a good thing too. That kind of corruption only
flourishes under a Republican form of government. They want a strong man
in France, that's what they want.</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> I don't believe much in your strong men. I suppose the
last Emperor was a pretty fair specimen; but they seem to have had some
high old ramps under him, too. Besides, look at Russia.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> You can't bring Russia forward as an example.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Of course not. Russia don't count.</p>

<p><i>A. M.</i> Why not? I don't suppose you can make a man much stronger than
the <span class="sc">Czar</span>; but, if we're to believe what we're told, the whole place is
honeycombed with corruption. Why&mdash;(<i>to</i> First W. I. M.)&mdash;you were saying
yourself, only the other day, that Russia was corrupt to the core.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Oh, but I was speaking of something quite different.
Russia is a country <i>per se</i>.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> I thought Russia was an Autocracy.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> It's the same thing.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>after a pause</i>). Well, anyhow, we in England haven't
done anything of the kind. You can't deny that.</p>

<p><i>A. M.</i> No, we haven't done anything quite on the same scale lately, I
admit that. But we've done our best with worthless mines, and bogus
Companies of all kinds, and financial papers, and Building Societies.
Seems to me we've no right to chuck stones at poor old <span class="sc">Lesseps</span>.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Is that the same old chap who did something in Egypt some
years ago?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>smiling, and superior</i>). Yes, the very same. He made
the Suez Canal.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Of course&mdash;so he did. That was what we went to the Soudan
for, wasn't it?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>dubiously</i>). Well, it had something to do with it,
of course. As we'd got four million pounds' worth of shares in the
Canal, we couldn't afford to see it upset. And then (<i>brightening</i>)
there was the Dual Control. That was really at the bottom of the whole
business.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> The Dual Control? I don't remember what that was.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Why, don't you remember <span class="sc">Arabi</span> setting himself up
against the <span class="sc">Khedive</span>? Well, naturally, we couldn't stand the two of them
playing their games there; so we just had to nip in, and smash old
<span class="sc">Arabi</span>.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Of course, I remember the whole business now; Khartoum, and
the <span class="sc">Mahdi</span>, and all the rest of it. [<i>A pause.</i></p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>returning to the charge</i>). I wonder why they called it the
Panama Canal?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Why shouldn't they? It happens to be its name.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Yes, I know that's its name now. But why call it after a
straw hat?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>amazed</i>). After a <i>what</i>?</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> After a straw hat.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>calmly, but firmly</i>). It isn't called after a straw
hat. The straw hat's called after it. That's all.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>dogged, and unconvinced</i>). Well, anyhow, I know I bought a
Panama hat last summer&mdash;and deuced expensive it was, too.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> My dear boy, it was made in Panama. Panama's a place.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Well, I'm dashed! I never knew that. But what on earth do
they want a Canal there for?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Oh, well, I'm bound to admit it would be a convenience.
Just think how it would shorten the sea-route. Instead of having to go
all the way round Cape What's-his-name&mdash;what <i>is</i> that blessed Cape's
name?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>tentatively</i>). Cape of Good Hope?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> No, no&mdash;they're building the Nicaragua Canal for that.
Cape&mdash;Cape&mdash;why, dash it, I shall be forgetting my own name next!</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>brilliantly</i>). Capricorn.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Yes, that's it! Well, instead of having to go all round
Cape Ricorn, all we've got to do is to sail to Panama, and&mdash;(<i>impotently
concluding</i>)&mdash;there we are!</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Ah, but I don't think they'll ever finish it.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> I'm not so sure about that; but, of course, the French
couldn't do it.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Of course not.</p>

<h2>VERY CIVIL LAW.</h2>

<center>(<i>With Mr. Punch's Compliments to the London County Council.</i>)</center><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>The Interior of the Court under the Patronage of the London</i>
<i>County Council.</i> Judge, <i>appointed according to the popular view,</i>
<i>discovered in the act of passing sentence.</i> </span><br />

<p><i>Judge.</i> Prisoner in the dock, or I should say, my good friend&mdash;for are
we not all liable to err?&mdash;I have no wish to increase the natural
embarrassment of your position. I am here, as you know, to dispense
judgment. This I tell you judicially. I am, when I make this statement,
merely the mouthpiece of the Law. In my private capacity, I am deeply
sorry for you.</p>

<p><i>Prisoner</i> (<i>much affected</i>). Thank you kindly, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> My dear friend, I feel for your misfortunes. I make every
allowance for them. By the Statute under whose provisions both of us are
here, I notice that I have the power to sentence you to seven years'
penal servitude.</p>

<p><i>Prisoner</i> (<i>startled</i>). Seven years! But you ain't going to do it?</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> My dear friend, I will do nothing that is unjust.</p>

<p><i>Prisoner</i> (<i>angrily</i>). You'd better not, or you'll 'ear of it again!</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> I hope, I do hope that is not intended as a threat! My object
is to treat you courteously, and even considerately, but, as I have
already remarked, the Law is, in fact, the Law. Although I represent the
London County Council to a very large extent, still I am a Member of the
Bar, and, by virtue of my office, a gentleman. Under these
circumstances, I shall only be doing my duty&mdash;painful as its performance
may be&mdash;when I sentence you to be kept in penal servitude for seven
years.</p>

<p><i>Prisoner</i> (<i>indignantly</i>). What, seven years! Why, you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

Witness, whose official position, it appears, is "Hydrographer of the
Navy." What is a hydrographer? clearly, by derivation, "a drawer of
water." But a ship also "draws water." Therefore, logically, a
Hydrographer is a ship. But a ship is never put into a witness-box,
where it would be quite at sea, but in the dock, where it could be quite
at home. "Truly," writes our Puzzled Correspondent, "there is a muddle
somewhere." <i>Q. E. D.</i></p>

<h2>SAFE PREDICTIONS FOR THE YEAR.</h2>

<p>Someone will write about the extraordinary characteristic of the Season,
whether it be warm or cold.</p>

<p>There will be a Political Crisis in Paris on the average of once in
every six weeks.</p>

<p>The German Emperor will continue his tours, to the great inconvenience
of the Crowned Heads he favours with a visit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span> will lecture, write articles to the Magazines, fell trees,
and govern the country, as per usual.</p>

<p>Someone will get a trifle tired of Home Rule, the Channel Tunnel, and
General <span class="sc">Booth</span>.</p>

<p>A few persons will leave Europe for America, to see the Chicago
Exhibition.</p>

<p>A crowd (more or less) will attend the Oxford and Cambridge Boat-race,
the Derby, and the Private View at the Royal Academy.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="sc">Smith</span> (after having been presented by My Lady <span class="sc">Brown</span>) will present
Miss <span class="sc">Smith</span>, Miss <span class="sc">Elfrida Smith</span>, and Miss <span class="sc">Victoria Alexandra Smith</span>, at
Her <span class="sc">Majesty's</span> Drawing-Room.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. <span class="sc">Portland Snooks</span> will give a dinner-party, which will be
reported in the Society papers.</p>

<p>The First Nights at the Lyceum will be amongst the features of the
Season.</p>

<p>There will be several failures at the Theatres, and also a success or
two.</p>

<p>There will be half a dozen full-dress debates in the House of Commons,
and as many important divisions.</p>

<p>The "Popular Budget" is sure, with some people, to be exceedingly
unpopular.</p>

<p>The London County Council and the School Board will be censured by the
Press.</p>

<p>There will be any number of railway "accidents," and avoidable "deaths
by misadventure."</p>

<p>It will be discovered that the British Army is a myth, and that the
British Navy is a snare and a delusion.</p>

<p>Parliament will be up in time for the partridges, even if a little late
for the grouse.</p>

<p>Everyone will praise the United Kingdom as the land of the tourist, and
promptly go abroad.</p>

<p>A subject of deep domestic importance will be discussed in the columns
devoted to correspondence in the daily papers during the Silly Season.</p>

<p>A new Author will be discovered, and spring into great popularity with
the Publishers, if not with the Public.</p>

<p>Out of every hundred novels, ten per cent. will be absorbed by the
London Libraries, and the remainder carted off to the "Circulating Book
Emporiums" at the seaside.</p>

<p>Someone will write his experiences, and expect someone else to read
them.</p>
<p>A new Magazine will be started, to supply a want hitherto unsuspected.</p>

<p>There will be bags on the moors, and sales at the poulterers'.</p>

<p>The Christmas Numbers will be prepared in May and published in October.</p>

<p>The Divorce Court will be open for the Season, and the Season will amply
